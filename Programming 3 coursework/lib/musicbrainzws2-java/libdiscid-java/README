Java Bindings for libdiscid
andy@benow.ca - http://benow.ca

Description:

 Allows for calling of libdiscid from java, providing easy access
 to disc information, including musicbrainz and freedb disc id's for
 further retrieval of release information.


Requirements:

 - libdiscid 0.2.2 
   - debian/ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libdiscid0 libdiscid0-dev
   - windows: a binary is included in native/libdiscid-0.2.2-win32bin-mingw
   - others: http://musicbrainz.org/doc/libdiscid
 - java 1.4+ (http://java.sun.com)
 - apache ant  (http://ant.apache.org)
 - gcc, make


Compilation:

	You will probably need to recompile to match your platform.  To do so:

	> ant clean all
	
 NOTE: the os and jdk home are autodetected by the ant script, and then passed to the Makefile during native
 compilation.  Linux, freebsd and win32 (ming) have been tested and worked once upon a time.  
	
 Targets of note within the ant build file include:

	compile: compile java sources
	native: compile native code
	javadoc: compile javadoc
	clean: clean binaries
	jar: create a jar or the java source
  all: do everything

 An 'It works!' message should be spewed during native compilation.  This shows that there are no linking errors.


Usage:

 Usage is essentially identical to libdiscid.  See the javadocs and the included example.


Example:

 A quick disc query too is included.  Insert an audio cd and run 

	> run/query.sh /dev/sr0        (or other device)
	or 
	> run\query.bat d:\            (or other drive letter)


Testing:

 If you are having errors running the example, you might want to validate that the build and native linking works
 by doing the following:
 
  > ant clean all
  > run/query.sh /dev/sr0
  or
  > run\query.bat d:\
  
 It should print a message that it is working (printed from native code).  This means the native linking is working and
 libdiscid errors probably aren't due to compilation and linking (but rather to incorrect parameters, etc).  If
 this test does not work, take a look at the native/Makefile and try to refine the failed commands.  Fire me an email 
 (andy@benow.ca) if still no luck.
  

Deployment:
 
 For use in your apps, the dist/libdisc.jar must appear in your path.  The path to the native glue must also
 be visible within your library path.  An example startup would be:
 
 	> java -cp lib/musicbrainz-discid.jar -Djava.library.path=/path/to/libdiscid-java/native/[os]/[arch] org.my.CDRipper /dev/sr1
